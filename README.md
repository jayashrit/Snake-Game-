# Snake-Game-
A Snake Game built using Java
JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later
acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick
Naughton. It is a simple programming language. Writing, compiling and
debugging a program is easy in java. It helps to create modular programs and
reusable code. Java is an object oriented programming language This project is
to develop a snake game and it is developed using Java in which the concept of
graphical user interface is implemented, in which components like awt / swing
are used . Snake is an older classic video game. It was first created in late 70s.
Later it was brought to PCs. This game is sometimes called as Nibbles. This
project ( snake game ) is an replica of that older snake game.

In this project , oops concepts in java like object , class ,
encapsulation , inheritance and interface were implemented. I have also
implemented event handling mechanism to develop this snake game in which
interfaces like actionlistener and keylistener are used.In this game , components
like , JPanel , ImageIcon , Graphics were implemented and few methods to set
border , frame , panel , position size and color to fill the background were used.
In this game the player controls a snake. The objective of the game is to make
the snake eat as many food particle as possible. The snake was controlled with
the help of arrow keys. Initially, the snake's length has set to three joints. Each
time the snake eats a food partical its body grows , and the length of the snake
along with the score gets increased and it is displayed in the title. The snake
must avoid its own body , if it hits its own body the game gets over. If the game
is finished, the "Game Over" message is displayed in the middle of the board
